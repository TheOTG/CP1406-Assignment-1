<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>Kenny Anthony The<br>
<strong>Login:</strong>JC309977</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Improve CossiePlay's business by getting on the internet hoping to attract more people to come to their parties and get costumes made for them.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The target of making this website is to increase the number of cosplayers for more than 30 each month.<br>
  The number of website visitors is to gauge how efficient the website is but the success evaluation will be the number of cosplayers that come to the party.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Cosplayers are of all ages, mostly 35-50 years old. However, the website should be able to appeal to a younger audience such as high school kids and young adults.</p>
